# Examples workflow via Github Actions
# This workflow can be manually trigger to run the steps below across
# various configurations specified in the matrix (eg. python3.7, etc.):
#
#  - Setup docker environment and caching strategy
#  - Build base docker image with dependencies required for building CLIF
#  - Run INSTALL.sh script
#  - Build and install examples modules
#
# Workflow can also be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch.
